# todo-list

This is a copy of what my todo board in notion looks like. It allows users to create projects and add todos to them. Todos and projects can be deleted and edited (actually project names cannot be edited rn I didn't even think of adding that). It was great for practicing using classes and development using webpack. I definitely got the hang of using js to create dynamic html.

When I come back to this I would like to:
- finishing a task doesn't delete it just removes it from the board
- add an animation when the sidebar is closed/opened
- make the dates actually work as dates and make the notes into a text area rather than just a text input box
- Overflow when not all projects don't fit on screen (see notion for a better explanation)
- Split up backend and dom manipulation better and just overall structure could use a lot of work
