# todo-list

This project is a simple task management application that allows users to manage their tasks with customizable properties and views. It is a copy of the way in which I use Notion.io to manage my own personal tasks. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as sort and filter them based on various properties. It is similar to my other todo list project but created using vanillaJs
